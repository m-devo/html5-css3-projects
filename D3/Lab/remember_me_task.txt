Task Description:
You will build a simple login form with a "Remember Me" feature.
- The form should have:
  - An email input
  - A password input
  - A "Remember Me" checkbox
  - A Login button

When the user checks "Remember Me" and logs in:
- Save the email in localStorage.
- Next time the page is loaded, the email field should be pre-filled automatically.

If "Remember Me" is not checked:
- Do not save the email.

Requirements:
1. Create an HTML form with email, password, checkbox, and button.
2. Use JavaScript to handle the "Login" button click.
3. If "Remember Me" is checked:
   - Save the email in localStorage.
   - Load the email from localStorage whenever the page is refreshed.
4. If "Remember Me" is not checked:
   - Remove the email from localStorage.

Bonus (Optional):
- Show a message: “Welcome back, [email]!” if the email is remembered.
- Add a "Clear Remember Me" button to remove stored data.
- Save both email + password (only for practice, not recommended in real apps).
